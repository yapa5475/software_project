Vision

Our vision at LiveTutoring is to help students with last minute exam and homework help. Balancing classes, homework, work, clubs, a social life, and various other extra curricular activities on top of studying can take a toll on students. There can come times where every student may need help to acheive their highest potential. When extra help is needed, it is often hard for students to easily and effectively find assistance.

This is where LiveTutoring comes in. LiveTutoring is dedicated to help students find quick help when time is short or they are struggling to get a handle on a concept. By creating an account, students can look for available tutors and schedule an appointment with them in order to get quick, effective help.
